          <p>Senegal has over 19 million ha of land of which only 3.9 million ha is suitable for arable crops while the rest is undeveloped bush and arid areas used for livestock grazing (Alessandro et al., 2015). Out of the arable land, 40% is constantly cultivated with around 10% of the cultivated area receiving less than 500 mm of rainfall. This limits crop production.</p>

          <p><br> To solve these impediments, MEDA and CIAT therefore partnered to implement the AVENIR project with an aim of improving the socio-economic well-being and resilience of farming households with an emphasis on women and young people, in Sedhiou and Tambacounda. This will be attained through: <br> * Increasing socio-economic empowerment of women and youth;<br> * Sustainable intensification of irrigated and climate-change  adapted crops, including agroforestry,   horticulture and rice crops;<br> * Improving local governance and territorial management of water resources.</p>

          <p>According to the African development bank (2019), Senegal Real GDP growth has been above 6% on <br> average since 2015, propelled by the Plan for an Emerging Senegal (2014-18). Growth dropped to 6.0% <br> in 2019 from 6.7% in 2018. Public investment in infrastructure, agriculture, and energy kept the fiscal <br> deficit at 3.6% of GDP in 2018 and 2019. Inflation in 2019 remained low at 0.2%. Rising oil prices and <br> equipment imports increased the current account deficit in 2019 to 8.8%. This is projected to rise to 9.7% in 2020 and 9.8% in 2021. Real GDP was expected to reach 6.3% in 2020 and 6.8% in 2021 (AFDB, 2019) <br> before covid-19 but has since been revised to 3.1% in 2020.</p>

          <p>There is a local tropical climate with a dry and a rainy season. From December to April, the dry season <br> has hot, harmattan wind while most of the rainfall occurs from June to October. Inland temperatures<br> are higher than along the coast. For example, when Dakar is 23.2 C, Tambacounda is 32.7 C and temperatures here can reach as high as 54 C especially on the border with Mali. <br> Rainfall increases substantially farther south, exceeding 1,500 mm annually in some areas.

          <p><br> The onset of rainfall initially begins in the southeast around May/June, and spreads northwest throughout the summer months (Marteau et al., 2009). The annual rainfall of Senegal is received from June to September with August receiving the highest volume of rainfall, followed by September, July, and June (Camberlin and Diop, 2003). The remaining months of the year are generally dry, resulting in a dry season lasting summers for about six months in the south and eight months in the north. The highest seasonal rainfall is received in the southern parts of the country (approx. 1000 mm during the rainy season), while the northern parts are drier (less than 400 mm) (USAID, 2017, 2015). The rainy season ends with the migration of the ITCZ to the south around October (Nicholson, 2018).</p>

              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>In 2016, agriculture represented 18% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product), employing 52% of the total labour force. About 80% of people in rural areas work in this sector. In 2013, commercial farming represented 10% of the land under production. 90% of agricultural land is worked by small-scale, family-based farms engaged in subsistence agriculture.</p>

              <h3>Farming systems</h3>
              <p>Farming systems are mostly rain-fed. Senegal’s dominant commodities are groundnuts (grown as a cash crop), rice, meat and millet, followed by fruits (such as watermelons and mangoes) and vegetables (tomatoes and onions). Despite this, the country imports about 70% of the rice it requires for domestic consumption.</p>

          <p>The agricultural sector of Senegal contributes to about 17% of the country’s GDP employing more than 70% of the workforce.Senegal has over 19 million ha of land of which only 3.9 million ha is suitable for arable crops while the rest is undeveloped bush and arid areas used for livestock grazing. Out of the arable land, 40% is constantly cultivated with around 10% of the cultivated area receiving less than 500 mm of rainfall. This limits crop productionthe sector consists primarily of rainfed agriculture which is very vulnerable to risk associated with climatic change. Irrigation could be the solution to this but only 10% of the cultivated land is under irrigation with the main irrigation areas being along the Senegal river and the Casamance.<br> <br> The major crops grown in Senegal are groundnuts and millet, which account for approximately 75% of all the cropped area. Other crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, cowpeas and cotton are also grown making approximately 25% of the cropped area while other crops, such as vegetables account for less than one percent of the cropped area (Elberling et al., 2003). As food production does not meet country’s demand, the country is forced to import rice and wheat (Diagne et al., 2013). On the other hand, Senegal exports cotton, groundnut oil and horticultural products mainly green beans, tomatoes and mangoes (D ’Alessandro et al., 2015).</p>

          <h2><span class="rev">Irrigation</span></h2>
          <p>Senegal relies heavily on rainfed agriculture in which only 12% of the country is arable hence the requirement for irrigation. The country’s irrigation potential is about 340,000 ha while the developed areas cover 105,000ha, with a 60% exploitation rate. Approximately 41,000 ha are farmed along the river, 10,000ha in the Niayes, 9,000 ha in Lower and Middle Casamance, with the rest shared between Anambé and eastern Senegal.<br> <br>Types of development include large irrigated areas along the rivers and in Anambé (400 to a few thousand ha); medium-sized land in the same areas (60 to 300 ha); irrigated village plots (PIV) along the Senegal River and eastern Senegal (20 to 30 ha); private irrigated land (PIP) all along the river, around Lake Guiers and the Niayes (50 to 400 ha); bottomlands at Kédougou (10 to 50ha). <br> Of Senegal’s irrigation potential, 30 percent is not yet irrigated. Of the equipped areas, about 60 percent were cultivated in 2009, mostly for rice and vegetables. This ratio has been improving over the last few years.</p>

          <p><i><br>Droughts<br> Senegal is located in the Sahelo-Sudan zone where drought has been occurring sporadically for several decades attributed to erratic rains. This has been documented for the years 1996-1998, 2002, 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2018. Droughts generally impact the arid and semi-arid Sahelian regions (northern Senegal) every three to four years. Since 1980, droughts have affected more than 3 million people. The drought of 2011 led to reduced food production in most parts of the country as well as inflation. In the Casamance where Sedhiou is located, rainfall deficit is known to favour salinization of groundwater and soils. In 2018, the drought led to depletion of pastures and also intensified clashes over resources between nomadic pastoralists<br><br>Floods<br> Floods occur more frequently than droughts, but droughts have more severe consequences and affect many more people per event. Flooding annually affects about 200,000 people and has an $89 million impact, with large-scale flooding in 2009 largely in the Dakar region causing about $104 million in damages and losses. Flood risk is exacerbated by rapid urbanization, insufficient drainage, and poor sewage infrastructure, which has resulted in the settling of low-lying areas and a reduction in soil infiltration potential. In Tambacounda, the Gambia river is known to overflow its banks, causing massive damage to local banana plantations.</i></p>

          <p><i><br>In Sedhiou, Agriculture plays a major role in running the economy while in Tambacounda, agriculture and mining are the main sectors. However, 60.5% of the population in Tambacounda and 67% of the population in Sedhiou are poor.<br> In Sédhiou, lack of infrastructure prevent producers from expanding their market across the Country limiting the movement of agricultural products. In addition to this, poor quality of roads and bridges is a concern for the economy of this region. In Tambacounda, poor infrastructure limits access to markets or water.<br> In Senegal, there is low access to credit by small scale farmers due to, fear of default risk due to climate change, disbursement delays, lengthy procedures, high travel costs to financial institutions, high application fees, high interest rates &amp; guarantees, lack of irrigation water and high account maintenance fees.<br> Women are reported to have less land to cultivate than men, which inhibits their production and access to credit while youth are seen as risky targets to offer credit as they are often unemployed, lack a guarantee and might disappear with the loan to another country</i></p>

In the first quarter of 2010, deliveries in age of adolescence (10-24 years, according to WHO) were 31.03% of the total. During the second quarter, the percentage increased to 39.01%. The total births during the period from January-June were 1588, including 470 births by teenage mothers, which is the 29.6% of the total. The number of teenage abortions in the same semester is 37. Early pregnancy is very numerous. Women lack information on prenatal health care matters leading to deaths. <br> Challenges of hygiene are highly significant due to lack of good health infrastructure and ineffective waste management. Inadequate availability of drinking water is a major challenge with most of the population using water from the wells, which unfortunately is not treated and not drinkable. All these factors cause health problems. <br>Women work in the farms without the help of men in addition to feeding and taking care of their families<br>At all levels of education, the proportion of girls completing their education is lower than that of boys. distance from school, which in many rural areas, is dispersed.</i></p>

However, there is an increase in sensitivity for most crops such as baobab, cashew, pepper and onion. This increase in sensitivity for crops is likely because of the projected increase in temperature leading to higher heat and moisture stress.</i></p>

          <p><i>Crop vulnerability in 2030s under RCP 4.5 is greatest in the regions of Kaffrine, Tambacounda, Sedhiou, Kolda and Kedougou which are mainly in the central, south and south-eastern parts of the country. There are also other specific Arrondissements with high vulnerability elsewhere across the country. On the other hand, vulnerability is lowest in Ziguinchor areas and areas near Dakar. Some areas towards the north especially in Thies and Louga have lower vulnerability to climate change probably because of their closeness to the capital as well as their ease of access to markets, low food insecurity as well as high technological and institutional capacity.<br> For RCP 4.5, for 2050s, vulnerability to climate change is seen to reduce probably because of the positive impacts from the implementation of regenerative measures to mitigate climate change effects. On the other hand, in RCP 8.5, in 2030s the vulnerability is higher compared to RCP 4.5. For RCP 8.5 for 2050s climate change will exacerbate vulnerability in the country especially in the north. In the areas of greatest vulnerability i.e., central, south and south-eastern parts of the country, it was noted that there was a high reduction in the suitability of most of the crops selected for this analysis. These areas also experience high poverty rates, low access to health facilities, high rates of stunting, wasting, underweight and malaria mortality. In additions, these areas have low access to markets, low literacy rates, high food insecurity and low technological capacity. However, these areas have the highest opportunity for farming using irrigation and carry-over residual soil moisture.</i></p>
