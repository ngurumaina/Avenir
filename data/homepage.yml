Droughts generally impact the arid and semi-arid Sahelian regions (northern Senegal) every three to four years.
Since 1980, droughts have affected more than 3 million people. The drought of 2011 led to reduced food production in most 
parts of the country as well as inflation. In the Casamance where Sedhiou is located, rainfall deficit is known to 
favour salinization of groundwater and soils. In 2018, the drought led to depletion of pastures and also intensified

Floods occur more frequently than droughts, but droughts have more severe consequences and affect many more people per event. 
Flooding annually affects about 200,000 people and has an $89 million impact, with large-scale flooding in 2009 largely in the 
Dakar region causing about $104 million in damages and losses. Flood risk is exacerbated by rapid urbanization, insufficient drainage, 
and poor sewage infrastructure, which has resulted in the settling of low-lying areas and a reduction in soil infiltration potential.
In Tambacounda, the Gambia river is known to overflow its banks, causing massive damage to local banana plantations.

  This is attributed to high climatic variations in the east and south of Senegal, which lead to overall declines in crop 
  suitability. The results show that under climate change, there will be a decline in crop suitability for rice in Tambacounda, 
  Sedhiou and Kedougou pepper in Tambacounda and Kolda, Ditakh in Sedhiou and Kolda, and okra in Tambacounda.<br>

  title : "Vulnerability to climate change"
  content : "Crop vulnerability in 2030s under RCP 4.5 is greatest in the regions of Kaffrine, Tambacounda, Sedhiou, 
  Kolda and Kedougou which are mainly in the central, south and south-eastern parts of the country. There are also other 
  specific Arrondissements with high vulnerability elsewhere across the country. On the other hand, vulnerability is lowest 
  in Ziguinchor areas and areas near Dakar. Some areas towards the north especially in Thies and Louga have lower vulnerability 
  to climate change probably because of their closeness to the capital as well as their ease of access to markets, low food 
  insecurity as well as high technological and institutional capacity.<br>
  For RCP 4.5, for 2050s, vulnerability to climate change is seen to reduce probably because of the positive impacts from the 
  implementation of regenerative measures to mitigate climate change effects. On the other hand, in RCP 8.5, in 2030s the 
  vulnerability is higher compared to RCP 4.5. For RCP 8.5 for 2050s climate change will exacerbate vulnerability in the 
  country especially in the north. In the areas of greatest vulnerability i.e., central, south and south-eastern parts of 
  the country, it was noted that there was a high reduction in the suitability of most of the crops selected for this analysis. 
  These areas also experience high poverty rates, low access to health facilities, high rates of stunting, wasting, underweight 
  and malaria mortality. In additions, these areas have low access to markets, low literacy rates, high food insecurity and low 
  technological capacity. However, these areas have the highest opportunity for farming using irrigation and carry-over residual 
  soil moisture."

  title : "Recommendations"
  content : "The adaptive capacity for the farming population, can be enhanced through improving literacy rates, access to 
  educational institutions and health facilities; improving nutrition outcomes (stunting, wasting and underweight), and developing 
  marketing, transportation and irrigation infrastructure. Priority areas for improving crop vulnerability are the eastern, south 
  and south eastern areas of Senegal, which include Kaffrine, Tambacounda, Sedhiou, Kolda and Kedougou regions."

  content : "Component 1: Increase socio-economic empowerment of women and young people.<br><br>
  a; To increase the capacity of women and youth to profitably operate agribusinesses in selected climate-change adapted value chains, entrepreneurship training and coaching on ‘farming as a business’ will be offered. The women and youth will also be linked to appropriate financial products and services for their agricultural and irrigation needs.
<br>b; In order to improve market access for women and youth, market linkages will be facilitated by identifying and building partnerships with companies and value chain actors.
<br>c; In order to enhance leadership capacity of women and youth to respond to climate change impacts, the project will identify and work with champions and women/youth role models who promote women and youth leaders in their communities.

  a; Training will be conducted through various channels such as demonstration sites, service providers, extension agents, radio, and social media. with agricultural and irrigation input and service providers that promote sustainable technologies and techniques, improve yields while protecting or regenerating the environment, and enhance crop resilience to weather changes in order to improve access to agricultural and irrigation inputs, technologies and techniques that promote sustainable intensification of selected climate-change-adapted crops.
<br>b; The project will identify cost-effective and climate-adapted agriculture and irrigation techniques and technologies for adoption so as to increase the capacity of agricultural and irrigation input and service providers to provide products and services that promote sustainable intensification of selected climate-change-adapted crops to farmers.

  content : "<br>Component 3: Improved, sustainable and equitable local governance and territorial management of water resources.<br>
  a; Training and dialogue will be done to increase the capacities of local/territorial actors (government, civic groups, market actors) to manage water resources sustainably and equitably. Market actors will be engaged and incentivized to adopt and scale-up sustainable and equitable technologies for improved land and water management. Smart incentives, business case development and demonstrations will be used to promote community uptake of new technologies for improved, sustainable and equitable management of water resources that considers both socioeconomic and biophysical aspects. 
<br>b; The project will strengthen IWUAs for the operations and maintenance of community-owned or managed irrigation schemes by using collected user fees or service charges. This will increase the capacity of women and youth, to manage water resources.
